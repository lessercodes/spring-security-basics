# Spring Security Basics

This is a sandbox project that was created for the sole purpose of learning Spring Security and take notes in the process.

### Spring Security dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Because of Spring Auto Configuration, adding the dependency automatically secures the endpoints and provides a 
login (`/login`) and logout (`/logout`) page.

### Basic Auth

Basic Auth can be configured by customizing the `SecurityFilterChain` bean.

```java
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
    return httpSecurity
        .authorizeRequests(conf -> {
            conf.anyRequest().authenticated();
        })
        .httpBasic()
        .and()
        .build();
}
```

Basic Auth flow:

1. Try to access secured endpoint
2. Without providing valid credentials `FilterSecurityInterceptor` throws an `AccessDeniedException` indicating that the request was denied.
3. The `ExceptionTranslationFilter` handles the exception and initiates `Start Authentication`, which sends a `WWW-Authenticate` header to the client.

To access the secured endpoint we should use the credentials provided by Spring Security. By default, Spring Security creates a user 
named `user` with a randomly generated password in the form of a UUID string. The password can be obtained by taking a look
at the logs generated by the application.

To customize the default user we can use the following two properties:
```properties
spring.security.user.name
spring.security.user.password
```

If we want to use multiple users we need to provide a `UserDetailsManager` bean. `UserDetailsManager` is an interface and
it's simplest implementation is the `InMemoryUserDetailsManager`.

```java
@Bean
public UserDetailsManager userDetailsManager() {
    final UserDetails user = User.builder()
            .username("user_1")
            .password("password_1")
            .roles("ROLE")
            .build();

    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user);
}
```

This configuration creates a user in place of the default one. In this case the username will be `user_1` and the password
will be `password_1`.
